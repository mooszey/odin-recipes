        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Duck a l'orange is one of those classic dishes that somehow became a clich√©, and people stopped making it for fear of looking un-cool, which is too bad, since it's really good.</p>
            <p>This is traditionally done with a whole roasted duck, but by using duck breasts we get pretty much the same results in a lot less time.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 duck breast halves</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Seville orange marmalade, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon reserved duck fat</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
             </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
             <ol>
                <li>Score duck skin almost all the way through the skin and fat each way on the diagonal in a crosshatch pattern. Generously season with salt and rub salt into each breast. Let rest, skin-side up, at room temperature, for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk chicken broth, orange liqueur, sherry vinegar, orange marmalade, orange zest, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Pat duck breasts dry with paper towels. Re-season skin-side of duck breasts with salt.</li>
                <li>Heat duck fat in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Place duck in skillet, skin-side down, and cook for 6 minutes. Flip duck breasts and cook until they start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer breasts to a plate to rest. Pour any rendered duck fat into a glass jar.</li>
                <li>Return skillet to medium heat and whisk flour into pan; cook and stir until flour is completely incorporated, about 1 minute. Pour orange mixture into skillet; bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens and is reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. When orange mixture stops bubbling, add butter; stir until butter is completely melted and incorporated into the sauce, about 1 minute. Season with salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Slice duck breasts across the grain, arrange on a plate, and spoon orange sauce over the top.</li>
             </ol>
       <h3>Chef's Note</h3>
             <p>You can substitute vegetable oil for the duck fat.</p>
